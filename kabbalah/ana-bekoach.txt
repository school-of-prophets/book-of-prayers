chapter: Ana Bekoach
chapter-aka: The 42 Letter Name of God

chapter-sum: Ana Bekoach is a prayer / meditation upon the 42 letter name of God.
chapter-sum: It has a song that can be sung or listened to which makes it easier to meditate upon for those who don't know the language.
chapter-sum: The 42 letters are divided up in to seven angels or seraphim. Each seraph has 6 letters or wings. The wings work in pairs. With two they cover their feet. With two they cover their face, and with two they do fly.
chapter-sum: The unity of the seven seraphim is as the Name.
chapter-sum: The words of the prayer are a mnemonic which not only uses words which start with the letters, but words which capture the essence of the seraphim and and therefor the nature of HaShem (the Name).
