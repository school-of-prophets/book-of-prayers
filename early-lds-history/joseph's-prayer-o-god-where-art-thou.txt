. O God, where art thou? 
. and where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?
.
. How long shall thy hand be stayed 
. and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, 
. behold from the eternal heavens 
. the wrongs of thy people, 
. and of thy servants 
. and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?
.
. Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs
. and unlawful oppressions 
. before thine heart shall be softened towards them,
. and thy bowels be moved with compassion towards them?
.
. O Lord, God Almighty, 
. Maker of Heaven, Earth, and Seas, 
. and of all things that in them are 
. and who controleth and subjecteth the devil, 
. and the dark, and benighted dominion of Sheolâ€”
.
. Stretch forth thy hand, 
. let thine eye pierce, 
. let thy pavilion be taken up, 
. let thy hiding place no longer be covered, 
. let thine ear be inclined, 
. let thine heart be softened 
. and thy bowels moved with compassion toward us;
.
. Let thine anger be kindle against our enemies,
. and in the fury of thine hart,
. with thy sword,
. avenge us of our wrongs.
.
. Remember thy suffering Saints, O our God, 
. and thy servants will rejoice in thy name forever.
