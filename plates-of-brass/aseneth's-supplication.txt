chapter-sum: Which she prayed after abandoning the elohim of Egypt and sought shelter in YHVH.
chapter-sum: As Recorded in 2 Moses 9:10-18

. YHVH, El Elyon who didst create all things,
  and didst call them from darkness into light,
  and from error into truth,
  and from death into life;

. Yea, El Elyon that created the heavens above,
  and the earth we stand upon,
  and the waters of the deep;

. O YHVH, hear my supplication:
  Yea, unto thee, YHVH, I present my supplication, 
  for thou, O YHVH, 
  didst stretch forth thy hands over me, 
  even as a Father that loves his children 
  in their pity and ignorance,

. And thou hast grown as a tree within me, 
  for the sake of thy Wisdom, 
  and because of this have I abandoned the elohim of my fathers 
  and destroyed their likeness;

. For thou, O YHVH, 
  hath delivered me from their hands, 
  and rescued me from that serpent 
  that sought to rip at me, 
  cast me into the abyss, 
  into the deepest depths of the Nile:

. But I have been swallowed up in the arms of my Mother, 
  and thou, O YHVH hath me 
  when the father and mother of my flesh didst deny me;

. For I have left behind their elohim 
  for Thee, 
  and I have no other hope 
  save in Thee, 
  O YHVH;

. Therefore, YHVH, 
  renew my flesh, 
  give me power by thy breath, 
  that I should raise these, my sons, 
  unto thee, 
  O YHVH;

. That they too 
  might eat of the bread of life, 
  and drink the cup of thy blessing, 
  which thou has prepared 
  for thine elect.
