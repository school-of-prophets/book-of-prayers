chapter: Neum's Prayer of Praise

chapter-sum: As Recorded in Neum 3:8-16

. Blessed be YHVH,
  who executes deeds of righteousness,
  crowning His qaddishim with His love,
  and His kindness, and His mercy.

. My soul does cry out to praise Your Name,
  to sing praises to El Elyon for your loving deeds,
  to proclaim your faithfulness unto Israel and unto Judah!

. And I say:
  There is no end to my praise of you, YHVH.

. I was near death for my sins,
  and they did sell me off captive;
  but you did save me, O YHVH,
  according to your great mercy.

. And I have loved Your Name, YHVH,
  and in you have I found my strength
  and my protection.

. When I remember your might, my heart is brave
  and upon your mercies I do lean;
  you have forgiven my sins, O YHVH,
  and purified me from my iniquities.

. Instill in me a spirit of faith and knowledge,
  for I am not ashamed,
  though I stand in the midst of those that would see my destruction.

. Do not allow the adversary nor the unclean spirits control over me;
  let not pain and evil desires conquer my bones.

. O YHVH, you are my praise!
  I shall sing and praise you all day long;
  my desire is ever that my brothers and my sisters of Judah
  would rejoice with me.
