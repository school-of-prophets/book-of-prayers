chapter-sum: Neum's Prayer of Praise

chapter-sum: As Recorded in Neum 3:8-16

. Blessed be YHVH, || who executes deeds of righteousness, || crowning His qaddishim with His love, || and His kindness, and His mercy.

. My soul does cry out to praise Your Name, || to sing praises to El Elyon for your loving deeds, || to proclaim your faithfulness unto Israel and unto Judah!

. And I say: || There is no end to my praise of you, YHVH.

. I was near death for my sins, || and they did sell me off captive; || but you did save me, O YHVH, || according to your great mercy.

. And I have loved Your Name, YHVH, || and in you have I found my strength || and my protection.

. When I remember your might, my heart is brave || and upon your mercies I do lean; || you have forgiven my sins, O YHVH, || and purified me from my iniquities.

. Instill in me a spirit of faith and knowledge, || for I am not ashamed, || though I stand in the midst of those that would see my destruction.

. Do not allow the adversary nor the unclean spirits control over me; || let not pain and evil desires conquer my bones.

. O YHVH, you are my praise! || I shall sing and praise you all day long; || my desire is ever that my brothers and my sisters of Judah || would rejoice with me.
