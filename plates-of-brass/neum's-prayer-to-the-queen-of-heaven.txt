chapter: Neum's Prayer to the Queen of Heaven

chapter-sum: As Recorded in Neum 6:1-21

. O Holy Mother!
  Never was there a place unknown unto thee!

. Never was there one that desired mercy
  that you showed not mercy unto them!

. Who are they that have not asked for your mercy?
  Shall Judah be denied thy shield and thy protection?

. Who are they that have not found solace in you?
  In the Presence?

. Who are they that have not found succor in your bosom?
  Or solace in your womb?

. And who is Israel
  that she shall be denied your succor and your solace
  that your child should be shattered
  and scattered about unto the foreign winds?

. YHVH, I pray thee!
  Give unto me thy hope,
  for it is not vain!

. O Holy Mother,
  give unto me your succor and your solace,
  for your peace is even an eternal peace!

. O Elohim,
  wipe away these, my tears, that my heart be content;
  have mercy for all those that live upon the footstool of YHVH,
  and have mercy upon Israel!

. For my heart is content
  to kneel at your footstool,
  to gain favor in your sight.

. My desire, YHVH,
  is but to come into your Presence,
  to see that beautiful Mother,
  the Queen of the Heavens,

. To dance in Her orchards,
  and to gather up the fruits of Her garden,
  and to delight in the flowers of Her fields!

. O Mother of the lamb of sacrifice!
  Bride of the Heavens!
  Even as YHVH is the very Father of Israel,
  so too are you her Mother.

. How I long to stand in your Presence,
  to rest my wounds in the healing power of your flowing waters!

. O fountain of healing!
  O wellspring of grace!
  You are a home of peace unto my soul.

. You are the most precious gem of the heavens,
  Mother of YHVH, and a virgin most pure!

. O Divine Mother,
  how you weep for your daughter, Zion!
  How you lament for her,
  but not in vain!

. For she shall return unto YHVH
  weeping in her sorrows,
  humbled in her defeats;

. Yet YHVH shall be glorious,
  yea, YHVH shall ever be undefeated.

. YHVH, I invoke you in my mourning,
  for I know this: In your name have I been spared.

. You, Zion, shall scorn me,
  and leave me forgotten;
  but YHVH shall remember.
