chapter: Neum's Prayer of Thanksgiving

chapter-sum: As Recorded in Neum 2:45-57

. I thank you, O YHVH,
  for your eyes are awake
  and they do watch over my soul!

. You have rescued me from the passion of idle talkers,
  from the company of those who would seek
  the pleasant words of flattery
  that lead souls away.

. Israel to the North, you hath let slip away,
  but they are not hidden from you!

. Save therefore the soul of the poor
  who they planned to destroy
  by spilling the blood of your servant.

. I walked this walk for you,
  YHVH, my Elohim,
  but they did not know this.

. They laughed at me,
  sought to shame me
  with lies from their mouths!

. But you didst support the soul
  of the poor and the weak,
  you did save me from their harsh arms,

. You redeemed me amid their taunts;
  from the wicked I do not fear destruction.

. Surely even the maggot can praise you, YHVH,
  and the worm remembers your love and kindness;

. Yet they who have tasted of death but returned
  have forgotten you,
  and your people have stumbled,
  having forgotten to sing your praises.

. Your kindness has been revealed unto them,
  and your righteousness has enlightened them,
  Elohim Shaddai.

. For in your hands are the souls of every living thing;
  you have given the breath of life unto all flesh.

. Deal with us, O YHVH, according to your goodness,
  according to your great mercy,
  and according to your many righteous deeds.
