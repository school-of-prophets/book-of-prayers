. O Lord, behold, this people repenteth;
. And they have swept away the band of Gadianton from amongst them, 
. insomuch that they have become extinct, 
. and they have concealed their secret plans in the earth.
. 
. Now, O Lord, 
. because of this their humility, 
. wilt thou turn away thine anger, 
. and let thine anger be appeased 
. in the destruction of those wicked men whom thou hast already destroyed?
. 
. O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, 
. yea, thy fierce anger, 
. and cause that this famine may cease in this land?
. 
. O Lord, wilt thou hearken unto me, 
. and cause that it may be done according to my words, 
. and send forth rain upon the face of the earth, 
. that she may bring forth her fruit
. and her grain in the season of grain?
. 
. O Lord, thou didst hearken unto my words 
. when I said: Let there be a famine, 
. that the pestilence of the sword might cease;
.
. And I know that thou wilt even at this time 
. hearken unto my words, 
. for thou saidst that: 
. If this people repent, 
. I will spare them;
. Yea, O Lord, and thou seest 
. that they have repented 
. because of the famine, 
. and the pestilence, 
. and destruction 
. which have come unto them.
. 
. And now, O Lord, 
. wilt thou turn away thine anger 
. and try again if they will serve thee?
. 
. And if so, O Lord, 
. thou canst bless them according to thy words 
. which thou hast said.
