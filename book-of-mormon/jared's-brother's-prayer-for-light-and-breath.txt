chapter-sum: As recorded in Ether 2:18-25 OPV
chapter-sum: Or Ether 1:47-59 RAV

The Brother of Jared. O Lord, 
. I have performed the work which thou hast commanded me,
. and I have made the barges according as thou hast directed me.
.
. And behold, O Lord, in them there is no light. 
. Whither shall we steer?
.
. And also we shall perish, 
. for in them we cannot breathe, 
. save it is the air which is in them; 
.
. therefore, we shall perish.


The Lord. Behold, thou shalt make a hole in the top thereof
. and also in the bottom thereof; 
. and when thou shalt suffer for air, 
. thou shalt unstop the hole thereof
. and receive air.
.
. And if it so be that the water come in upon thee, 
. behold, ye shall stop the hole thereof, 
. that ye may not perish in the flood.

Narrator. //And it came to pass that the Brother of Jared did so according as the Lord had commanded.//

The Brother of Jared. O Lord, 
. behold, I have done even as thou hast commanded me; 
. and I have prepared the vessels for my people, 
. and behold, there is no light in them.
.
. Behold, O Lord, 
. wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness?

The Lord. What will ye that I should do 
. that ye may have light in your vessels?
.
. For behold, 
. ye cannot have windows, 
. for they will be dashed in pieces; 
. neither shall ye take fire with you, 
. for ye shall not go by the light of fire;
. 
. For behold, 
. ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea; 
. for the mountain waves shall dash upon you.
.
. Nevertheless, 
. I will bring you up again out of the depths of the sea; 
. for the winds have gone forth out of my mouth, 
. and also the rains and the floods have I sent forth.
.
. And behold, I prepare you against these things; 
. for howbeit, ye cannot cross this great deep, 
. save I prepare you against the waves of the sea, 
. and the winds which have gone forth, 
. and the floods which shall come.
.
. Therefore, 
. what will ye that I should prepare for you, 
. that ye may have light 
. when ye are swallowed up in the depths of the sea?
