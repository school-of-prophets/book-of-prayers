chapter: The Blessing

chapter-sum: How a Father Should Teach His Household to say Grace at Meals.

chapter-sum: The children and servants should come to the table modestly and with folded hands and say.

. All eyes look to you, O Lord, and You give everyone food at the right time.

. You open Your generous hands and satisfy the hunger of all living things with what they desire [a]. (Psalm 145:15-16). 

. Lord God, Heavenly Father, bless us and these gifts, which we receive from Your generous hand, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. 

[a] "What they desire" means that all animals get so much to eat, that they are happy and cheerful. Because, worry and greed interferes with such desires.
