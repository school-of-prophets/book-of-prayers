. My Heavenly Father, I thank You, through Jesus Christ, Your beloved Son, that You kept me safe from all evil and danger last night. 

. Save me, I pray, that you will keep me safe today from every evil and sin as well, so that all I do and
the way that I live will please you. 

. I put myself in your care, body and soul and all that I have. 

. Let Your holy Angels be with me, so that the evil enemy will not gain power over me. Amen
